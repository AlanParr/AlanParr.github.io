Microsoft have really upped their upgrade game.
<!--end_excerpt-->
Pre-Windows 8, there was no point even bothering with an upgrade. Even if it completed without bricking your machine, the end result would be so unstable you'd just pave it and start again anyway.

The upgrade from 7 to 8 was relatively painless, I only needed to reinstall a handful of applications afterwards, not a big deal.

8 to 8.1 was seamless, as you'd expect given that 8.1 was essentially a service pack.

I've now upgraded 8.1 to 10 on 2 machines and the process has been almost perfect. On my home machine, I actually have one less bug than I had before!

About the only criticism I have is that you lose your start screen layout, but in reality this isn't a big deal and has encouraged me to do a little spring cleaning of my start screen apps.

I never thought the day would come when I'd start a Windows upgrade and not be already digging out my installer archive in preparation for a clean install.

Well done Microsoft, keep it up.
